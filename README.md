# AJS 37 Checklist

This is a normal procedures checklist for the SAAB AJS 37 "Viggen" in DCS World.  

The main purpose of this project was for me to have a simple checklist to go through when playing the AJS 37.  
That's still the case but I decided to share my work in case anyone else would find it useful.

To download a PDF of the checklist go to [AJS-37 QRH.pdf](AJS-37%20QRH.pdf) and click on "[Download](https://github.com/Carlgo11/ajs37-checklist/raw/master/AJS-37%20QRH.pdf)".

The checklist is made to mimic the British Airways' normal checklist design:

## Printing :page_facing_up:

* I recommend printing the PDF with one page per paper and then adding a blank paper in-between the pages. That way the red on the back page doesn't shine through.

* To bind the pages together I recommend using a laminating machine (or possibly self-adhesive laminating sheets).
